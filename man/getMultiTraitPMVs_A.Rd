\usage{
getMultiTraitPMVs_A(AddEffectList, genoVarCovarMat)
}
\arguments{
\item{AddEffectList}{list of ADDITIVE effect matrices, one matrix per trait, Each element of the list is named with a string identifying the trait and the colnames of each matrix are labelled with snpIDs.}

\item{genoVarCovarMat}{variance-covariance matrix of marker genotypes, i.e. measuring linkage disequilibrium}
}
\value{
tibble with estimators for all pairwise variance and co-variance parameters.
}
\description{
For an additive only model, compute _all pairwise_ variance and co-variance parameters from the post-burn-In, thinned samples of marker effects obtained using an Bayesian multi-trait model fit to some current population.
Wraps `posteriorMeanVarCovarA()` over all trait variances and co-variances.
Posterior mean variance or co-variance (PMV) and also the variance of posterior means (VPM) estimators are returned.
Both M1, i.e. "Method 1", which does not account for LD in the population and M2 or "Method 2", which does, are returned.
