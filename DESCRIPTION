Title: Prediction of family genomic variances and covariances
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Marnin Wolfe <wolfemd@gmail.com>

Description: 
      The predCrossVar package contains a complete set of functions for the prediction of additive and dominance genetic variances and co-variances among full-siblings based on parents. 
      Enables the prediction of genetic variance on multi-trait selection indices.
      Built for diploid organisms with phased, chromosome- or linkage-group-ordered biallelic marker data, and a centimorgan-scale genetic map.
